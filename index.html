            <div class="text-box">
                TLK is home to a diverse student body, and we also have a large amount of clubs which help to represent this
                while providing studnets the oppertunity to expand their learning to go outside of class.
            </div>
            
            <div class = "left-line">
                To regester an account for a club you must first speak to a teacher or other staff to get it officially regestered as a 
                school club. After this speak to a SAC exec to gain the code for the account and to have them create a club
                page for you on the site.
